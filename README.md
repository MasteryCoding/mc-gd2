## What is Game Development 2?

Game Development 2 (GD2) is the second year course in Mastery Coding's Game Development pathway. GD2 builds on knowledge gained during GD1 and pushes students to build more complex projects.

## GD2 Projects

In GD2, students learn about game development by developing games. The course teaches students to build five different projects, each demonstrating core development concepts for different genres as well as covering fundamental computer science topics including but not limited to: Control Structures, Collections, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, Event-Driven Architecture.

### Unit 1 Project: Rocket Kart Racing

</div>

This project teaches students how to build an physics-driven arcade racing project combining game mechanics from classic racing games with mechanics from Rocket League. 

#### Topics
- Unity Physics System
- Unity Physics API
- Particle Systems
- User Interface Design and Implementation

### Unit 2 Project: Voxel World

  <img src="https://github.com/torbenwb/mc-gd2/blob/main/visual-assets/u2-2.gif" width=320 height=240/>
</div>

The Voxel World project teaches students how to programatically generate meshes at runtime to build a prototype version of Minecraft where the player can explore and endless procedurally generated world, placing, and removing different types of blocks.

#### Topics
- Procedural Generation
- Mesh / Graphics Fundamentals
- Runtime Optimization
- Asynchronous Loading / Unloading

### Unit 3 Project: Collectible Card Game

</div>

The Collectible Card Game project teaches students how to build a Collectible Card Game similar to games like Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering. Students learn how to create a highly interactive user interface and how to build a scalable system for designing and implementing new card and creature types using Unity Scriptable Objects.

#### Topics
- User Interface Design and Implementation
- User Interface Visual Effects
- Scriptable Objects
- Scalable Design

### Unit 5 Project: MOBA Prototype

</div>

The MOBA Prototype teaches students about fundamental concepts in Game-Based Artificial Intelligence and Agent Behavior. Students build a prototype where two teams of AI-controlled agents face off, incorporating a system of task priority and AI pathfinding algorithms.

#### Topics
- Introduction to AI Pathfinding Algorithms
- Unity Navigation System
- Agent Behavior Design and Implementation

### Unit 6 Project: First Person Action Game
